Felicity and the Fifth Element: Love
======================================

My entry for js13k2014

NES style single screen platformer, inspired by Popeye, Megaman and Iceclimber

As of right now, the game is REALLY hard. Didn't have time to balance the gameplay.

Only one level, there is no penalty for leaving the hearts in the water and
the enemies can't shoot you.

And worst of all....the duck is backwards!
